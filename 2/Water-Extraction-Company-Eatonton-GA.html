<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and cracked chimney can often allow rain during the colder months which can seep through the walls. Over time, wetness from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to flake, peel and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  area.<p>
