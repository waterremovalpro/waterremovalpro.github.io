<p>I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.<p>
