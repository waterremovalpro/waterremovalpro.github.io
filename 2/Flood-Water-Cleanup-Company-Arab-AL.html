<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. There is a terrific video listed below that I encourage you to watch. We came across it while assisting a reader with a RV water damage repair. Not only does it do a terrific task of revealing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the developer also shows how to repair the damage action by step. Now this repair was done in 2011 to a Fleetwood Prowler 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, however the concepts still use even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass outside.</p>
