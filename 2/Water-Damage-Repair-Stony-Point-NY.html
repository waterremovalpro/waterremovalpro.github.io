<p>Mold - the look, the smell, even the thought of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food crammed in the back of your fridge, or an old decrepit bath tub that hasn't been utilized in years. But aside from what might be growing in your fridge, household mold is actually very typical, and can represent a significant health hazard if left uncontrolled. After getting rid of all polluted and damp products, contact someone who can inspect your home and start the restoration process.<p>
<p>Utilize a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it might accidentally press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might try vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to draw more water out if the phone was totally immersed. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is imperative to prevent recontamination. You should seal and instantly get rid of materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
