<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Brawley</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
