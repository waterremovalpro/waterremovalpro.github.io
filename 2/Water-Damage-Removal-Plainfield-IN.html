<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
