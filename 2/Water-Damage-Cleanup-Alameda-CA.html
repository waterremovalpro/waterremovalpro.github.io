<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at threat of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floorings and walls is another potential result of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can buy devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to lessen the production of moisture in the home are all really crucial in managing high humidity that regularly triggers mold development in our environment.</p>
