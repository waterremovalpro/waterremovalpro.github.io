Using bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface area however the roots within the material will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This procedure absorbs moisture without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
