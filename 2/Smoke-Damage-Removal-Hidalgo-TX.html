Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

Frequently, mold spores can be gotten rid of quite easily from surface areas. However a stain can stay. A complete mold remediation and stain removal must be carried out to insure a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
