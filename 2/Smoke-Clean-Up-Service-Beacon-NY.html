<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most disastrous things that can occur to a family or a person. To start attending to a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you should recognize the source of the water. It is possible for water to travel far from the site of the leak and trigger damage in other places, in unforeseen locations. If you aren't sure where the leak is, contact a certified plumber to help you out. Without recognizing the source of the water, the issue will resurface again later.</p>
<p>1st Action Disaster Cleanup is Seattle's premier disaster restoration company that uses quickly, 24-hour action, trained and experienced specialists, and direct insurance billing. The company supplies professional service for flooding and drain backups, and crews of trained personnel quickly eliminate water and hazardous waste, dehumidify and dry structures and personal belongings, and repair or replace damaged drywall, flooring, and framing. Emergency service is available for fire and smoke damage, and the company supplies shingle, window, and roofing system repairs after serious storms and hail.</p>

<p>Fire is the result of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - furniture, carpet, or drywall - has been heated to its special ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and should be dealt with by experienced specialists, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, product of this chain reaction.

<p>We will do our finest to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for a time period, end up being completely damaged (i.e. they will never be the exact same). Other products may simply need to be sanitized and transferred to high ground. Soft items like clothing, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can schedule you. Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), which will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what need to be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, reserving items that we feel can not be effectively brought back so you can make a list to develop into your insurance coverage adjuster. Your Adjuster will then figure out a compensation for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>
