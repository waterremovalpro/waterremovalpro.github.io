<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
