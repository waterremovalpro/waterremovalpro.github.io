<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on floorings and walls is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending on the degree of damage. Moldy odors can stick around in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can acquire gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to reduce the production of wetness in the home are all extremely important in controlling high humidity that regularly causes mold growth in our environment.</p>
