<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air motion throughout wet surface areas of products or assemblies is a crucial element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion across the surface of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface area moisture gives way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
