Food: Undamaged, commercially-prepared foods in all-metal cans or retort pouches can be saved if you get rid of the labels, completely clean the cans, wash them, and after that decontaminate them with a sterilizing option consisting of 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of safe and clean water. Lastly, re-label containers that had the labels removed, consisting of the expiration date, with a marker.<p>
