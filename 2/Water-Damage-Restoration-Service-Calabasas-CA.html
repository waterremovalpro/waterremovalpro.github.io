<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke discolorations. This phase is necessary, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to raise stains from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces below. Or merely grab a brand-new sponge. Ensure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the spots.</p>
