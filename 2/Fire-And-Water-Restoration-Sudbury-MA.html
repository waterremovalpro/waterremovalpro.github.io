The very best method to avoid mold growth is to remove water leakages or moisture in your house. See our post, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold avoidance pointers.</p>

In the case where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop before drying, fixing it may simply need pushing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
