<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is ended up.<p>
