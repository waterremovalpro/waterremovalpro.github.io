Mold remediation removes and cleans up mold colonies and extreme mold development from surface areas inside your home, getting mold levels 1 back to what is considered typical" for your location and air humidity levels 1 Since it is not possible to ensure removal" of all the mold in a building, many companies use what is called remediation services, cleaning and eliminating the mold problem from your home.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes suggest disposing of specific types of surfaces and things. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common products in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which likewise includes sweeping and vacuuming up any dirt or minor particles ignored in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum makes sure that even small particles get collected to decrease the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make two times as sure that mold does not find a way out of the contained work area and into a different part of the building.</p>
