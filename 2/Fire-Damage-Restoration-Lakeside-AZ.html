<h3>Drying Carpet After Water Damage in Lakeside Arizona</h2>
<p>Since it's impossible to get rid of mold in your house totally, it's important to keep your air clear by regularly replacing air filters. Think about using High Effectiveness Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is typically 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from distributing. You might also think about an air purifier that will get rid of mold spores. If you live in a particularly moist environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself remains free from mold.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When moist incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This procedure absorbs moisture without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily run listed below freezing temperatures.</p>
