<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
