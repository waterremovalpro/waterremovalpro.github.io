Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation.

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
