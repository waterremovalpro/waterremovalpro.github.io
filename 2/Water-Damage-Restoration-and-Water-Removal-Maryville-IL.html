Use the cloth on the moldy location to eliminate the mold with the sodium bicarbonate and water option.<p>
<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall materials usually don't dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's generally best to rip them out to prevent mold, particularly if they aren't completely dry within 48 hours.
