<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at threat of mold development. There is a great video listed below that I encourage you to enjoy. We came across it while assisting a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not just does it do an excellent job of showing you the damage that water can do to a Recreational Vehicle, the developer also demonstrates how to repair the damage step by step. Now this repair was performed in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, however the principles still use even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass outside.</p>
