<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the sluggish and gradual wear and tear of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reputable timetable for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements typically begin rusting right away after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue.
