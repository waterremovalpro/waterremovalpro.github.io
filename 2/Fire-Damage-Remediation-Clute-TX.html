<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at your home within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, floors and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Excellent, professional care. Very pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to detail to guarantee the water damage was dried entirely.</p>
