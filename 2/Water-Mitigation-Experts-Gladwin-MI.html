<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Gladwin</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is completed.<p>
