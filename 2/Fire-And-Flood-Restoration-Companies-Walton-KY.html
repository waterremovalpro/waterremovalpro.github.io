Condensation in the location between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roof, which can result in mold and decomposing.

Some materials will take on more water than others, and some products can be more challenging to dry. Do not hesitate to ask our service professionals daily to show you the progress we are making in the drying procedure.
