Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being fully replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor may require changing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The sort of wood flooring you may have identifies and limits the type of repairs that require to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a larger series of choices to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual planks. The best method to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that avoids water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
