<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any situation, especially when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater impends unless fixed quickly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Since the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it damp can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and just begins to sag prior to drying, repairing it may just require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
