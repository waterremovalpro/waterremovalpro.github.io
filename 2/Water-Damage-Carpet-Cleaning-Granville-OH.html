<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Once InstaScope was created, we engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged professional on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was designated to confirm and evaluate the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
