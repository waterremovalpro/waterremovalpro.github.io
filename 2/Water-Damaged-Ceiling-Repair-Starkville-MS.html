While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most visible, and destructive, product of this chain reaction.

How quickly the rust procedure takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.
