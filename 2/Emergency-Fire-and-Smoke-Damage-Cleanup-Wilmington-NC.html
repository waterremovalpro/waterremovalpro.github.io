<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size.

<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
