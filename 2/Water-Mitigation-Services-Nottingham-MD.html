Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
