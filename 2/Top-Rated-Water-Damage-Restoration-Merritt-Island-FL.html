<p>The most crucial aspect of fixing drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most regularly when wet drywall sits with inadequate ventilation.

Standard home fans are not efficient in moving an adequate quantity of air needed to dry a space adequately.</p>

All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading out too.</p>

LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or improved step to lower the moisture-laden air temperature level once inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
