A more likely scenario, sadly, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the drink. So you're taking a look at two uninviting alternatives: power down (but at the same time cause the screen and operating system to wake up briefly prior to switching off) or leave the gadget in sleep mode and hope you do not get any notices.<p>
