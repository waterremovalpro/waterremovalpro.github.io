<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>As you can see, the longer the water stays in the materials, the more danger is involved, the more materials need to be gotten rid of and the more odor is developed. Getting a company onto the site as quickly as possible is extremely important. Getting control of the environment, such as wetness material and humidity, is extremely crucial.
