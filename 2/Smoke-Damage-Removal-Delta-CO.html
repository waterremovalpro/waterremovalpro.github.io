There is no reputable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts usually start wearing away right away after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of an issue. How quickly the rust procedure takes depends on a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
