There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air.
