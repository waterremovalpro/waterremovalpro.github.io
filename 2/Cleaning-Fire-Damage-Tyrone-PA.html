After a heavy rain storm, a fast action is CRITICAL to lessening prospective secondary damages and costs to your Portland home or service. Drying out after water damage should top any cleanup concern list. One-half cup of family chlorine bleach to a gallon of water can be used on nonmetallic, colorfast surfaces as a disinfectant (to kill surface area mold and germs) after cleaning, however it will not avoid new mold growth on materials that remain moist.<p>
