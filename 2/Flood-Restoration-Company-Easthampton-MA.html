<p>When you are planning big repairs, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges.
