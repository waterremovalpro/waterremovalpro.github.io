<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Rockdale</h3>
<p>Numerous molds flourish at typical indoor temperature levels; few if any molds are able to grow below 40 F or above 100 F. Outside this range molds may stay non-active or inactive; they may begin to grow again when the temperature level is more beneficial. Temperatures well above 100 F will kill mold and mold spores, however the specific temperature level needed to eliminate specific types is not well developed.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, employees and others out of the affected area. Attempting to dry the area with a fan might disturb the spores and spread them to a brand-new location.
