<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Rockdale</h3>
<p>Numerous molds flourish at typical indoor temperature levels; few if any molds are able to grow below 40 F or above 100 F. Outside this range molds may stay non-active or inactive; they may begin to grow again when the temperature level is more beneficial. Temperatures well above 100 F will kill mold and mold spores, however the specific temperature level needed to eliminate specific types is not well developed.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, employees and others out of the affected area.
