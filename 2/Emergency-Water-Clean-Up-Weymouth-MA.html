Did you understand that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
