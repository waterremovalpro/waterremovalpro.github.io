<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often twice a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
