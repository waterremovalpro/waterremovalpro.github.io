Basic home fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>

<p>Water damage is something every homeowner dreads. It can strike at any time as a result of a pipeline burst, flood, or other disasters. It can trigger more damage if water is not cleaned up rapidly. Water can discover its way into the contents of your home, your furniture, and even the ceilings and walls, increasing the damage with every minute it stays sitting. At Alpine Cleaning & Restoration, our knowledgeable Everett water restoration group understands the importance of working rapidly to minimize further damage.</p>
<p>Because big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches may require a complete replacement panel installed. It depends upon where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For instance, if the area where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to protect a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to change the entire drywall panel.</p>
