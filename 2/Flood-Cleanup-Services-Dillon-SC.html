<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Over time, roofing systems may establish dark streaks. It may be dirt that can be just power-washed off, or it may be mold. You should not have anything growing, and even developing an inviting environment, for animals, bugs, or birds. It's going to begin to wear and degrade faster if the plants and fauna of your community decides to settle in on your roofing system. If you observe your roofing system looking in need of some attention, talk with a professional contractor.</p>
