<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

Lots of people swear by uncooked rice, advising owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the stuff (cover it entirely) and leave it there for 48 hours approximately. A: Mold is a tiny fungus that belongs to the natural surroundings and required for our environment. While it is needed in the outdoor world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unhygienic and harmful. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
