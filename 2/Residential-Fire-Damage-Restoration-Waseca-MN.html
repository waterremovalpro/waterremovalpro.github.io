<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electricity, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements usually start wearing away immediately after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
