When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly.
