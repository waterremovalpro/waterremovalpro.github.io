<p>Learn how to get rid of black mold securely and successfully. Picking up the pieces in the aftermath of the storm can be both physically and emotionally taxing.

We have brought structure and contracting experience into our franchise over the past 2 and a half years to better serve our communities after suffering a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
