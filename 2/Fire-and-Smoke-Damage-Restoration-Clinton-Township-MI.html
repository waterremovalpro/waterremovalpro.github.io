<p>One factor is that bleach can not totally eliminate mold growing in permeable materials. The chlorine in bleach can not penetrate into porous surface areas such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of permeable products and only the water part of the bleach is absorbed into the material, offering more wetness for the mold to feed upon.

Normally, repairs consist of the replacement of products, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to bring back the home or company to its pre-loss condition.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
