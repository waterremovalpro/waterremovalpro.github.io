<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone.

Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Crawl spaces frequently grow mold for the same factors as basements do-they tend to remain damp long-term. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and normally have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as large a mold development area, making common expenses more detailed to $500 for remediation. Because of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this area is typically less intense, so cleaning and removing affected areas is frequently enough.</p>
