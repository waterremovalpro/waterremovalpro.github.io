<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Remove all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to remove it. If drywall panels only show water stains however aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
