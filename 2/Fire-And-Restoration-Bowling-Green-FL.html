<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Bowling Green</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
