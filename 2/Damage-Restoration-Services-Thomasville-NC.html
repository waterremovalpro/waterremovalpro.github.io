<p>Particular sections of your home such as crawl areas, basements and attics are much more prone to water damage. Dark, wet crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they thrive. The concrete structure of your home can cause dripping in the basement if there is moisture leaking through it. Condensation in the area between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roofing system, which can cause mold and rotting. When checking your home for prospective causes of water damage make sure to watch out for moisture in lighting fixtures as well as the overall condition of any obvious piping.</p>

After scrubbing, leave the service for a little while to enable it to permeate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is setting in, you may now tidy up the wall debris. Use a vacuum cleaner to get rid of the moldy wall.</p>
