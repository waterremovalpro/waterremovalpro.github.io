<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible signs of wetness, dripping water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you may notice small signs like coffee-colored discolorations that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Because common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
