<p>Note: While the majority of experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, listed below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and allergen. Allergen are tiny animals associated with spiders, ticks and other mites. Dust mites consume mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins. Dust mites decrease allergen production at these lower humidity levels. Stop toilet texting - Browsing sessions and texting rallies always appear more immediate than they really are.
