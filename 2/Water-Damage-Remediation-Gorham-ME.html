<p>Note: While the majority of experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, listed below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and allergen.

Dust mites decrease allergen production at these lower humidity levels. Stop toilet texting - Browsing sessions and texting rallies always appear more immediate than they really are.
