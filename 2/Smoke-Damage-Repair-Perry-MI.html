<h3>Flooded Basement Repair in Perry Michigan</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, given the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and usually have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can trigger mold to flourish. And obviously, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to extreme weather or undetected leakages in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - carpet, furniture, or drywall - has actually been heated to its unique ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause enduring damage and must be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most visible, and damaging, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach because it is safe to use and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave toxic residue or produce toxic fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
