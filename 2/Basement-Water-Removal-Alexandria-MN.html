<p>Because mold spores are tiny, simply cleaning the areas that you can see is often insufficient to deal with the problem.

<p>The area that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can quickly take a trip once they are interrupted. Air purification systems are generally utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the area to get rid of as many airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the circulation of air between the infected space and the locations around it.
