<p>Since typical structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
