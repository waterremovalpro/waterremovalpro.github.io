<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
