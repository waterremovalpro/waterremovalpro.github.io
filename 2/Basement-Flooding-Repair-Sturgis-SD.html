Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying given that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going individual.</p>
