<p>Use a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it might accidentally press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to draw more water out if the phone was entirely submerged. As soon as the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is necessary to avoid recontamination. You need to seal and immediately get rid of materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, wash your clothes in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
