<p>Due to the fact that the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it wet can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying out, repairing it might just need pushing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
