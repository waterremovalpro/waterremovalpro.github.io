<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
