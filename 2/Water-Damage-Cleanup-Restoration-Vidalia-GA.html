Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>
