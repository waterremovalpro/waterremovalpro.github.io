<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you may notice small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might expand with time.</p>
<p>Negative air machines, geared up with HEPA (high performance particulate air filters") must be used to remove bacteria and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage must be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with correct waste holding tanks which should be dealt with properly. Difficult surfaces that are affected need to be cleaned and sanitized. Soft structural products such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard ought to be gotten rid of and properly disposed of. Any material that absorbs considerable amounts of moisture and can not be properly cleaned up must be gotten rid of. Once contaminated materials have actually been removed, a second application of sanitizers should be applied to all work surfaces.</p>

Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days.
