<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had been over flowing a second floor sink for 15 hours. Contacted Allied, signed work order on line and workers were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to reduce the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, floors and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Excellent, expert care. Very pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to information to ensure the water damage was dried entirely.</p>

<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Action online, and they were out within the hour.
