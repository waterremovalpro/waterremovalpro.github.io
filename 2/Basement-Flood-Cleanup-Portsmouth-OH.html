<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who confirms the existence of a mold problem needing action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work including suitable requirements. This document needs to plainly explain the actions that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for example how the affected location will be included or what the confirmation requirements are. Without a clear agreement in writing the conclusions, data, measurements are left to the analysis of each celebration.</p>
