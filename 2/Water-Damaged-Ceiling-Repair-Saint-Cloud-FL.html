<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. There is a fantastic video listed below that I encourage you to enjoy.

<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
