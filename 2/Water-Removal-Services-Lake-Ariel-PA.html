<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
