<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Middleburg</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and must be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
