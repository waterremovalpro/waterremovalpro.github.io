<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Malverne - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
