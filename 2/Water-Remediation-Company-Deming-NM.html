Mold replicate by ways of small spores. The spores are like seeds, but undetectable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surfaces.

Air filtering systems are normally utilized in combination with the sealing of the area to eliminate as numerous air-borne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air between the contaminated area and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be turned off to avoid the mold from spreading out too.</p>
