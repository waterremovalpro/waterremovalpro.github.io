<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion across wet surface areas of products or assemblies is a critical element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Quick air movement throughout the surface area of material ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture paves the way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>

We also installed portable heating fans to speed up the drying process.</p>
