<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and gradual degeneration of products (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you integrate electricity, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no trusted schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal elements usually begin rusting right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of a problem. How fast the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid.
