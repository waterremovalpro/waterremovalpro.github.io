Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>
