<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were really valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
