The ceiling or walls may show noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may sag or fall apart under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might discover small signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand in time.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice adequate kitchen upkeep, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.
