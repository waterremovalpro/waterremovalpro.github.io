<p>When you are preparing big repairs, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
