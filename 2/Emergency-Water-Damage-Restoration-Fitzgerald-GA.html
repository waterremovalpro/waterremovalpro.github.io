<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, however a weathered and broke chimney can typically allow rain throughout the colder months which can leak through the walls.

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
