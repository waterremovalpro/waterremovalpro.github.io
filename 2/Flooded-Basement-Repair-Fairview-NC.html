<p>Regrettably, however, utilizing bleach is only efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, bath tubs, glass and counter tops.

It is the slow and gradual wear and tear of products (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electricity, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal elements usually start rusting immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quick the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
