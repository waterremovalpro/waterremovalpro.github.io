<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By reducing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
