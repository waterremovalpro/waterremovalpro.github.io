<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health threat, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove as much as 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
