<p>Indoor mold development can usually be seen or smelled. In many cases, if visible mold development exists, sampling is not required. There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can use to evaluate a mold sampling outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold screening or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what type of mold might be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be expensive and, if done, need to just be done by experienced experts. Examine a mold issue; do not test</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>More involved testing may involve sending out samples to a testing center, or taking samples of the air to test if there is no noticeable mold, however mold is suspected.

Bear in mind, however, that it is often unwarranted, as many remediation services will continue the same method regardless of what kind of mold is found in your house.</p>
