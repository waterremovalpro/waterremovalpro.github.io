Did you understand that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
