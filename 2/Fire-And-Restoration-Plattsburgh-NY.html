<h2>Water Damage Restoration, What All Plattsburgh Home Owners Need To Know</h2>

<p>Learn how to remove black mold safely and successfully. Make sure to don appropriate protective gear if you select to handle the mold removal yourself. The CDC suggests that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, water resistant boots, and a mask ranked a minimum of N-95 or more to protect your nose and mouth. Note that while these masks protect you from small particles like mold, they are not sufficient if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
