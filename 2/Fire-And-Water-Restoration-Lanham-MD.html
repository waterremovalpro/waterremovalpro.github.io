<p>After you have actually cleaned up adequately, dry the surface areas with a clean rag. You may use fans to speed this procedure up. You probably still odor smoke odors, which can take a few days to a few weeks to dissipate. Take a look around the space, and identify materials that can easily soak up odor. You can put these products together in a separate space or outdoors to see if the odor dissipates after a couple of days; consider throwing away the products you can stand to part with. Getting your carpets expertly steam-cleamed can also aid with sticking around smoke odors - very same goes with any upholstery, furniture or drapes. Having these cleaned expertly will dramatically lower the smoke smell.<p>
