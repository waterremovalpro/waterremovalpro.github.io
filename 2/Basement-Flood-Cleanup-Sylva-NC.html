<h3>Why You Should Hire Sylva Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health threat and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
