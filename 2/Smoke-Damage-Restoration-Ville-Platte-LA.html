<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken.

Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned up are very first cleaned with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and ventilating agent. These several steps are needed to ensure ceilings and walls are clean and that residual odor has been eliminated.</p>
