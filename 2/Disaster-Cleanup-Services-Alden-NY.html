<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Alden</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health risk and must be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not kill mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, employees and others out of the afflicted area. Attempting to dry the location with a fan may interrupt the spores and spread them to a new location. Eliminating black mold is a step-by-step process that requires perseverance, an investment in protective gear and black mold removal products, and, of course, the nerve to brave dark, cramped areas occupied by toxic fungus.<p>
