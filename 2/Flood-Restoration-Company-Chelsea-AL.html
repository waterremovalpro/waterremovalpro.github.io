<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Chelsea</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Fire is the result of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. Once this flammable fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has been heated to its distinct ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unstable gases will be released in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause lasting damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most obvious, and devastating, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - indicating that as a fire enters into contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>After you learn how to get rid of mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling moisture is the crucial to stopping most mold. The worst invasions normally take place in damp crawl spaces, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with poor foundation drainage. Stopping leaks, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water far from the foundation are the very best defenses against mold.</p>
