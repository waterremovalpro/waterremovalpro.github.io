<p>Flooding of a personal sewage system can be a dangerous situation for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewage system can not function correctly (common pipes issues in old houses ).
