<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical offender of damage in a lot of our homes and organisations here in Central Illinois. Mold spores can spread out quickly when moisture is present.
