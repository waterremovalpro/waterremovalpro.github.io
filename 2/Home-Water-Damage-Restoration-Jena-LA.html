<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold development (it might look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we first look for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water using our truck-mounted extraction equipment.

All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading as well.</p>
<p>Jake (and his group) are amazing to deal with. They fasted to react at first and supplied a fair and affordable  quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done very rapidly. Our mold concern ended up being smaller sized than first thought so the final invoice reflected the actual work required and was less than first quoted. Jake was very responsive to calls and e-mails addressing questions throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
