<p>Because typical building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

This can arise from any variety of scenarios such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a broken pipe, or even a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can lead to trouble.

A more serious storm or deeper flood might include damage to even more pricey systems, like: ducts, the heating unit and air conditioner, roof, private sewage and well systems, utilities, and the foundation.</p>
