<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Kennett Square</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag prior to drying out, fixing it may just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
