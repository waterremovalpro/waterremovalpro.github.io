<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
