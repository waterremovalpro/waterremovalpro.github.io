<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
