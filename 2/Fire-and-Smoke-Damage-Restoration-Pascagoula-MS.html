Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working.

If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
