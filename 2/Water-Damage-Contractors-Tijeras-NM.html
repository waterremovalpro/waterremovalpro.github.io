<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier gets rid of water vapor from the air utilizing a process called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to remove a significant quantity of water vapor listed below 40 grains per pound. Since they are much more energy effective and they can pull the grains down much lower, lgrs are a special form of commercial and residential grade refrigerant dehumidifiers. LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or boosted step to reduce the moisture-laden air temperature level when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
