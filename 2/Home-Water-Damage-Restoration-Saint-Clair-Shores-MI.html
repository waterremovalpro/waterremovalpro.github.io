<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
