<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
