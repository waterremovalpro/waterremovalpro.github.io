<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
