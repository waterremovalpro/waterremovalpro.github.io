<h3>Water Mitigation Experts Canby OR 97013</h3>
<p>If you're really confident about doing Do It Yourself repair work on your iPhone, the best technique to a damp iPhone is to loosen the bottom screws (on a lot of models of iPhone this will need a proprietary type of screwdriver head, readily available as part of some iPhone repair sets offered by unofficial third-party accessory makers) and access the interior. Use the fabric on the musty location to remove the mold with the baking soda and water option.<p>
<p>Open all windows in the space to help with the drying process. If there are cabinets in the space, they need to be left open, too.
