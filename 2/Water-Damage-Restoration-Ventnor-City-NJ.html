This mold can be harmful to your health in the form of persistent sinus infections, asthma, and tiredness. It grows in locations that stay constantly damp, like a/c systems. In addition to being harmful, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it more difficult to effectively eliminate.

<p>These are normally great signs of mold, possibly harmful and certainly something you wish to eliminate. The taxonomic name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on carpet, ceiling, and wallpaper tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold. It produces a mycotoxin, microscopic mold spores, that causes mycotoxicosis. This is not something you can tidy up using a store and a sponge vac. This requires licensed mold removal, mold screening, and black mold remediation experts in Seattle, like those from Pacific Rim CR LLC.<p>
<p>Storm and flood damage can be devastating, and you require the company with storm damage experience. And last but not least, track your health for possible signs.
