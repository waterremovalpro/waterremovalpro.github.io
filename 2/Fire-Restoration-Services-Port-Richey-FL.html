<p>But you might not be able to get insurance coverage to pay for your mold remediation expenses if the damage is an outcome of your overlook-- for instance, if you've had a slow leak under your bathroom sink for years and have actually ignored the problem. They likely will not cover mold remediation expenses if the insurance provider can determine that the mold damage is a result of your carelessness. If you do not have flood insurance, your homeowner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss. If the flood has been stated a federal disaster by the President, make an application for assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
