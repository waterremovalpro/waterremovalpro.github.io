<p>Places that are often or always damp can be difficult to keep totally devoid of mold. If there's some mold in the shower or in other places in the bathroom that appears to reappear, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more frequently will normally avoid mold from repeating, or at least keep the mold to a minimum.

<p>You want to resolve bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew.

Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
