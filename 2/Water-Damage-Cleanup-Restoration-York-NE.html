While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
