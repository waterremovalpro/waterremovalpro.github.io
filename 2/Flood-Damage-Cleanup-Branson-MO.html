<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Branson</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health hazard and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some artificial products such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires wetness, although some mold species can acquire that moisture from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The permeable material can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of prospective damage.<p>
