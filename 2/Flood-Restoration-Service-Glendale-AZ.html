Get rid of all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just reveal water spots but aren't structurally jeopardized, they may be repairable by eliminating the damaged portion. When eliminating around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
