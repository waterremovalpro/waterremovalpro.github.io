<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or service is one of the most disastrous things that can occur to a person or a family. To start addressing a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you need to identify the source of the water. It is possible for water to take a trip far from the site of the leakage and cause damage somewhere else, in unexpected locations. Call a certified plumbing technician to help you out if you aren't sure where the leak is. Without recognizing the source of the water, the problem will resurface once again later.</p>
<p>A mold assessment is the primary step in the process of figuring out if you have a mold problem. During a mold examination, AdvantaClean's certified mold specialists, will check, sample and test the air in and around your home for mold detection. A mold specialist will use a variety of mold detection strategies to look for mold and mildew, recognize the kinds of mold present and offer tips for cleaning mold or removing mildew. Mold inspection is important to both the safety and health of a home and its occupants. Because mold remediation can often be costly, a mold inspection performed by a mold specialist is highly recommended.</p>
