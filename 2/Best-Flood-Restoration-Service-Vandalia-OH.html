If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
