<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
