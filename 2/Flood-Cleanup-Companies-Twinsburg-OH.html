Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
