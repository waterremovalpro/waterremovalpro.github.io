<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply begins to droop before drying out, repairing it may simply require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
