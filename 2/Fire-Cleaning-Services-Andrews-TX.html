As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
