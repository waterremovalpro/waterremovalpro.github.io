<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a large brush, and keep in mind that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall might require to be gotten rid of and changed. If basement carpet has become moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or utilize high-powered fans to remove wetness if it's affixed to the floor.</p>
