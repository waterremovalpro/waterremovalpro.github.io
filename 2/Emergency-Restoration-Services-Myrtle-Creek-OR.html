<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
