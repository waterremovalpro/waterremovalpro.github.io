<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly.
