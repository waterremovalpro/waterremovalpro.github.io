<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences.

Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
