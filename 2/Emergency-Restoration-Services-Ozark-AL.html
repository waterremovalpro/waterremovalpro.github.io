For items that can be brought back, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the location solid once again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>
