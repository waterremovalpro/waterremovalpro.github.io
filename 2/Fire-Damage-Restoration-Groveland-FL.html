They came back every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
