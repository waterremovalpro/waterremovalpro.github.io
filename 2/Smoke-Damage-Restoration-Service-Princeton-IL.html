A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even small particles get gathered to lessen the opportunities of the mold moving somewhere else. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold.

Ought to you choose to use bleach or another chemical, please read and carefully follow the label directions and risk statements (care, warning, threat). Do not mix bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, because a hazardous chlorine gas may be formed.</p>
<p>Since mold and mildew can be a major health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
