<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air movement throughout wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a critical part of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion across the surface of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials need different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also in some cases described as mildew, is a fungal growth that establishes on wet products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside your home, mold growth must be avoided. Mold recreate by ways of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, however unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, wetness, and available nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are numerous kinds of mold, but all require wetness and a food source for development.</p>
