Vinegar is frequently used along with baking soda when cleaning up a mold issue because vinegar eliminates different species of mold to baking soda.<p>
<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.
