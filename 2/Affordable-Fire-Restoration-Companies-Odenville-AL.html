It's an unfortunate fact that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Most likely the most common is the smashed screen, which we discuss in our post on getting a damaged iPhone repaired But the second most common is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home might require to be restored. Products like drywall and carpet that have taken in water typically establish germs and mold that can't be removed. Replacing these products is much safer than enabling transmittable organisms to fill the air.<p>
<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leakage or glowing floor heating leak), repairing the subfloor might even be needed. For best outcomes, refinish the entire space, as trying to repair a small location will show up for many years, providing an apparent indicator that the floor has had some form of damage. You can tell if your screen has actually been damaged by water if there are lines or dark spots under the glass. It is hard to say whether this damage is going to be irreversible or if it will result in other complications, so the best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
<p>After we inspect and examine the storm damage, we begin immediately on water removal, as water will continue to soak into the floors, walls, furnishings, and other locations of the home with each passing minute. To manage air-borne spores, moisten musty areas with a garden sprayer while you work.
