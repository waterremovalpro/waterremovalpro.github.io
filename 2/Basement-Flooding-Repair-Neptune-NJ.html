<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration Service in Neptune</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
