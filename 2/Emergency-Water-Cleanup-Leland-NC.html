<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electrical energy, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements typically begin wearing away instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem.
