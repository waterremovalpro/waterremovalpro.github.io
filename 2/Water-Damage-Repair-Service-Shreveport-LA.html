<h2>Major Drywall Repair Mistakes When Dealing With Water Damage in Shreveport</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>If you've just experienced a water event, you may be wondering what to do next: Seeping water damage is progressive, pervasive and can mean important things might end up being permanently damaged - especially if emergency action is delayed beyond the first two days. When wetness seeps into products of value there are immediate steps that can be required to minimize the amount of long-term damage that results.</p>

<p>Regrettably, however, utilizing bleach is just reliable if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and countertops. Bleach can not penetrate into permeable materials therefore it does not come into contact with mold growing below the surface area of products such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these materials will kill the mold above the surface but the roots within the material will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
