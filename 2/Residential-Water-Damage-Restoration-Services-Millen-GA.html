Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold development must be prevented. Mold reproduce by methods of tiny spores. The spores resemble seeds, however undetectable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas.
