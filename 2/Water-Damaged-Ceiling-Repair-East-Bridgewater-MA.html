<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration involves changing products like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as simple as setting up a few panels of drywall, while serious cases could require replacing whole walls. Direct exposure to harmful compounds like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older homes are most likely to consist of these compounds.</p>
