<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers prefer paper tape.

As soon as the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
