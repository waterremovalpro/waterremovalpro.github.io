<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is moist and excellent, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
