<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and likewise were really useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
