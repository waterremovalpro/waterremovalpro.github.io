<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a hazardous circumstance for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewer system can not work effectively (common pipes issues in old houses ).
