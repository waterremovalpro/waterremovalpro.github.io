<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can provide your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and broke chimney can often allow rain throughout the cooler months which can permeate through the walls. Gradually, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a exhausted and unloved space.<p>
<p>To buy time, place damp books and photos into plastic bags and place in a frost-free freezer. This will stop extra degeneration, and prevent mold and mildew. When you have time, obtain books from the freezer and air- or fan-dry the pages. Mold can grow practically anywhere, however it usually prospers in warm, wet or damp environments It can also sometimes be discovered in drier environments that have bad ventilation or air circulation.<p>
