<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or organisation can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
