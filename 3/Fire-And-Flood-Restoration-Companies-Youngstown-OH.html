<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really respectful individual.</p>
