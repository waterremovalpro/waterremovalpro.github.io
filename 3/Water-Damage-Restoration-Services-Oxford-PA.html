<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be much more damp than above-ground levels and typically have bad ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can cause mold to grow. And naturally, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather condition or unnoticed leaks in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be hard to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
