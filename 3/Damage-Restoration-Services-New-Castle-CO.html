<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in New Castle</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
