To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall.
