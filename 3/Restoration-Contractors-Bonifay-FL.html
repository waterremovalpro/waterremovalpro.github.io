<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Ceiling drywall panels might sag or collapse under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that may expand over time.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache since the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it might simply require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
