<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most destructive things that can happen to a family or a person.

<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year.
