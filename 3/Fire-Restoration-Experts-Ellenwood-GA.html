<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is wet and great, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
