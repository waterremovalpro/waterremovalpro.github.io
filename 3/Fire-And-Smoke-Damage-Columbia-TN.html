<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
