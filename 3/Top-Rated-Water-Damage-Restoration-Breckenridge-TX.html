<p>Prior to you clean your house, you ought to use correct protection. Soot, particles and smoke can be hazardous to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged area. Use long trousers and sleeves to protect your skin. You need to also wear gloves and eye security.

You can most likely get away with simply covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged location is small. But if you're cleaning a whole space, it's wise to get rid of those clean products and even seal other rooms that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you do not track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>
<p>Also, considering that bleach is mostly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly soaked up by the product.

If there is a great deal of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".
