<p>Many highly contagious illnesses are connected to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's illness, as well as kidney, liver, and blood concerns. Some of the mold on the surface area may be killed but the roots of the mold are left intact meaning the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated bleaching. Maybe this is why some individuals think that spraying bleach on mold does not impact it but instead just whitens its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs moisture, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Thoroughly pry baseboards away from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to understand the degree of prospective damage.<p>
