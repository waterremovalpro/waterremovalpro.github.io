<h3>Disaster Cleanup Companies in Scottsville Kentucky</h2>
<p>We recently had major water damage due to a washing device overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action required to prevent further damage working late into the night. They also completed the whole dry out which took a number of days and a lot of effort. Constantly gotten here on time and did what they promised and kept me notified of each step. It was an enjoyment to handle the entire group. I would not think twice to recommend them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent option to chlorine bleach due to the fact that it is safe to utilize and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind toxic residue or produce harmful fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
