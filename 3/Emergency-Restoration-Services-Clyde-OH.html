<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can happen by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up moisture through chemical destination instead of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a product that attracts and holds moisture. This product acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated exhaust air, the moisture vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a known irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health dangers would not be decreased till mold contaminants are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not suggest making use of ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
