They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster.
