<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
