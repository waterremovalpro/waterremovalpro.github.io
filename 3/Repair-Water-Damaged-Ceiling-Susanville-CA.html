<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
