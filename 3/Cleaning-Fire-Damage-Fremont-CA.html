<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying because the leak started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very courteous person.</p>
