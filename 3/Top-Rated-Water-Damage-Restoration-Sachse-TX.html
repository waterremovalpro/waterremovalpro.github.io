<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
