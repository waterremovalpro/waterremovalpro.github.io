<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any circumstance, particularly when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater is imminent unless fixed quickly, and the expenses increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
