These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and reasonable energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure materials and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
