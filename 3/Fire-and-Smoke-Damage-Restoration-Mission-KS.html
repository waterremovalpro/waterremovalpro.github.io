<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Mission</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health risk and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
