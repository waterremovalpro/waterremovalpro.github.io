<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it wet can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to droop prior to drying, fixing it might simply need pushing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job properly.
