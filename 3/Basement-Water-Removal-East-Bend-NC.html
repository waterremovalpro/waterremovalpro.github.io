Water intrusion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually soaked up minimal moisture.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This process takes in wetness without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>
