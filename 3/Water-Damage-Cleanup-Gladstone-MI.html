It is the gradual and slow degeneration of products (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal parts usually start corroding instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of a problem.
