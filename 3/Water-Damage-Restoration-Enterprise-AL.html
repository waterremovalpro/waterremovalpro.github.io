<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first look for any security threats, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely deal with it. If they have actually been damaged, we will likewise examine vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This stage is important, as these sponges use special chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it impossible to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a cleaning movement the entire time.
