<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
