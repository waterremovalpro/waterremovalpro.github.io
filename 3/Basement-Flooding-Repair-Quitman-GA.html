These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days.
