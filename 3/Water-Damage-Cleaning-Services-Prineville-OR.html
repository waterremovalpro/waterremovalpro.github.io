<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of several days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
