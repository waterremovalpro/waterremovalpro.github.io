<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable indications of wetness, dripping water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you might discover little signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may broaden over time.</p>
<p>Amongst the products we use to address mold concerns is the resurfacing agent Microbe Guard, which develops a new, irreversible layer over a surface.

A cornerstone of our approach to mold remediation is comprehensive prevention that obstructs the regrowth of harmful mold. People constructing a brand-new home or structure will discover our avoidance strategies especially crucial.</p>
