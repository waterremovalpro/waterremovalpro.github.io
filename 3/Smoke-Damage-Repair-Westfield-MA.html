<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or service is one of the most disastrous things that can occur to an individual or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being completely replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard may require fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood flooring you might have figures out and limits the type of repairs that require to happen. Solid hardwood flooring enables a wider series of choices to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of flooring can likewise have replacements for private planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
