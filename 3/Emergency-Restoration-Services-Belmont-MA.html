Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
