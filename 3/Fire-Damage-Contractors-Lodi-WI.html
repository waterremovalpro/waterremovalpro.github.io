<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Lodi</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
