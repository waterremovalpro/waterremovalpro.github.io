The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really costly paperweight.</p>
