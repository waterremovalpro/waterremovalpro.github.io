<p>You wish to deal with bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>It's a demanding scenario when water floods your floors, soaks into your walls, and damages your furnishings. Considering that a carpet cleaner can only do so much, you require a water damage cleanup group that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) take in moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable bundles of desiccants and damp products in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants alter color to show they are filled, which can take weeks or days, depending on just how much wetness products contain.<p>
