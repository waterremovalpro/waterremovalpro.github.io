<p>The most crucial element of correcting drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most often when damp drywall sits with insufficient ventilation. No matter the area or degree of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or comparable devices that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air required to dry a space effectively.</p>

<p>The Chem-Dry proprietary Hot Carbonating Extraction (HCE) cleaning process supplies a deeper, longer enduring clean for a healthier home.

It was a harsh experience, but everything they did for me was great. When they were offering me issues, they best thing about First Response was that they were able to manage my insurance company. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and managed the concern for me, which was a substantial relief.
