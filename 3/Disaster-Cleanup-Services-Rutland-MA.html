<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Easy drying techniques are often not enough when eliminating water from areas it is not expected to be. Your carpet, walls and floor coverings are porous which suggests an easy cleaning will not be enough and substantial water damage cleaning is needed. Surface area cleaning only eliminates noticeable contamination, however significant quantities of bacteria are often left behind, which can possibly trigger health problems as well as undesirable smells. All surfaces impacted by water damage need to be thoroughly cleaned, decontaminated and deodorized by trained professionals in order to appropriately eliminate disease-causing bacteria, fungi and other viruses before the area is safe for people once again.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
