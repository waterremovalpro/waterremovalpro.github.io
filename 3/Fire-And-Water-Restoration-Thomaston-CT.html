Water flood damage can be guaranteed just with a flood insurance plan written by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)-- no other insurance will cover flood damage. NFIP is offered through your insurance company or local Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) office. Their website is also an outstanding resource for additional information about water floods, consisting of readiness, data and disaster assistance services.</p>
