<h3>Water Damaged Furniture in Thomaston Connecticut</h2>
<p>Damage brought on by water that has actually been on the ground at some point before entering your home is considered to be water flood damage and is not covered by a standard homeowner's insurance policy. Water flood damage can be guaranteed just with a flood insurance plan written by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)-- no other insurance will cover flood damage. NFIP is offered through your insurance company or local Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) office. Their website is also an outstanding resource for additional information about water floods, consisting of readiness, data and disaster assistance services.</p>

However if you're cleaning a whole room, it's wise to eliminate those clean items and even seal off other rooms that are undamaged. Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot stains into other spaces.<p>
