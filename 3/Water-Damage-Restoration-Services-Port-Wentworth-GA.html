<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
