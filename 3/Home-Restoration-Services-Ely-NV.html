<h3>Los Angeles Water Damage in Ely Nevada</h2>
<p>We just recently had major water damage due to a washing device overflow. Rainbow came out to your house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and proceeded to take the action needed to prevent additional damage working late into the night. They also finished the whole dry out which took several days and a great deal of effort. Constantly shown up on time and did what they promised and kept me notified of each action. It was a pleasure to handle the entire team. I would not hesitate to suggest them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes.</p>
<p>Equipment utilized in mold remediation consists of: wetness meter: measures drying of damaged products; Humidity gauge: often paired with a thermometer; borescope: Video camera at the end of a flexible snake, illuminating prospective mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl areas; digital video camera: Documents findings during evaluation; individual protective equipment (PPE): Respirators, gloves, impervious match, and eye protection; thermographic camera: Infrared thermal-imaging video cameras recognize secondary moisture sources.</p>
