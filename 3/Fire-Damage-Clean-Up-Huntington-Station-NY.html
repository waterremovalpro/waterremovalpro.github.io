<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is crucial to identify if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and reasonable energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
