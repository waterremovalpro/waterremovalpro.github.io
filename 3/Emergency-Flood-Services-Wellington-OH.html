<h3>Water Extraction Damage Restoration in Wellington Ohio</h2>
<p>You can never ever entirely remove mold from your house; a little number of mold spores will always exist indoors and are a natural and useful  part of our world. Nevertheless, if water or moisture is left untreated inside your home and mold starts to colonize, it can pose a severe health threat. Mold remediation can rapidly and securely get rid of a mold invasion from your office or home.

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health risk, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove approximately 18 inches of drywall.

As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets.

<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
