Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floors and walls is another potential impact of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have actually happened and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice appropriate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from hard surfaces, and fix dripping faucets as quickly as possible. Constantly ensure your tableware and serving meals are dry before keeping them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets.

<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
