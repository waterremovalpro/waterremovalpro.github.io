<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is imperative to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and latent energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings should be included in the drying record to consist of hvac, equipment, and air systems. Moisture material levels for damp structural products need to be recorded in a wetness content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the building is back to an acceptable range of pre-loss condition. It is essential to understand that air records alone will not show that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if adjustments are required.</p>
