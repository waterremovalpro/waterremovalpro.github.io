<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can trigger wetness on the underside of the roofing, which can cause mold and decomposing. When examining your home for prospective causes of water damage make sure to look out for wetness in lighting fixtures as well as the total condition of any obvious piping.</p>
