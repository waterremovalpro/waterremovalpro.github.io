<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall since mold and mildew can be a severe health danger. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with full sheets.

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
