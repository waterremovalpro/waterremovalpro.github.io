<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is important to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and latent energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
