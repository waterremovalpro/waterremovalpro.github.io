<p>Flooding of a personal sewer system can be a dangerous situation for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's experienced pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It might cause a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewage system can not operate appropriately (typical pipes issues in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater depend on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to minimize the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa).
