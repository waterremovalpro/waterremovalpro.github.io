<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or company can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
