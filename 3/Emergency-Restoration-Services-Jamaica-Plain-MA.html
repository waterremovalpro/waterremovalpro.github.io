<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
