<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

A water disaster can be frustrating and demanding-- and a trustworthy, caring restoration team can help reduce your concerns and make the process of getting life back to normal, pain-free and hassle-free.
