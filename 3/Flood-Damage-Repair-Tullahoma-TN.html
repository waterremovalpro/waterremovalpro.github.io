<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke discolorations. This phase is important, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to raise stains from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas beneath. Or just get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you use a wiping movement the whole time. If you scrub the stains, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface.</p>
