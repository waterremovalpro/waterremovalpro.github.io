<h2>Water Damage Repair and Restoration Tips in Hockessin</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>After water damage occurs, your home will need to go through water extraction, drying and dehumidification so that you don't have mold problems down the roadway. By using state-of-the-art devices and techniques, a restoration company can accelerate the restoration procedure, help avoid future mold development, and help ensure your personal effects such as files, artwork, pictures and other essential products are properly taken care of and brought back.</p>
