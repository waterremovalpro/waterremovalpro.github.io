<h2>What To Do & What Not To Do After Flood Damage in West Des Moines</h2>

<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that wipe it away with a moist towel. Just like a few of the above methods, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
