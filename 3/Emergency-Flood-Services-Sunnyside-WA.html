In addition to being harmful, black mold can also stain surfaces it grows on, which can make it more difficult to successfully get rid of.

<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days.

There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal components usually begin wearing away instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the rust procedure takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
