Changing these materials is much safer than permitting contagious organisms to fill the air.<p>
<p>In order to secure yourself from bacteria in the water, mold on surfaces and the chemicals in cleaning materials, cover your body. Use trousers, long sleeves, boots, and rubber gloves. It seems weird (and remarkable) that mold can be discovered in a lot of houses; creating the need for remediation and cleaning.
