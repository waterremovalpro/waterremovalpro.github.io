<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can take place on its own if a fire is included. When home insurance coverage covers mold if it is the outcome of water damage associated to a typical peril.

<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health hazard and must be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Fire can cause large quantities of damage on your residential or commercial property. However, there are other damages that can seriously affect the building as well.
