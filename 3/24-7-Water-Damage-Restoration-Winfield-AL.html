<p>Many extremely infectious illnesses are connected to water damage including skin infections, liver disease A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's illness, along with kidney, blood, and liver concerns. Some of the mold on the surface may be killed however the roots of the mold are left undamaged implying the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated bleaching.

Make sure to get the wetness out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
