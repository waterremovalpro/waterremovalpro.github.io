<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly damaging. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was assigned to confirm and check the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can deliver clinically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
