<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold development (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen upkeep, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from tough surfaces, and repair leaking faucets as quickly as possible. Constantly make certain your tableware and serving dishes are dry prior to saving them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>
