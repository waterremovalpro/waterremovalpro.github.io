<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that wipe it away with a damp towel. As with some of the above approaches, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
