They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
