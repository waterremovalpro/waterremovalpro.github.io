<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

It is necessary to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if modifications are needed.</p>
