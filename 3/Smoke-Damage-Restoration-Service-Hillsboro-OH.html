They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
