Raising the temperature level of a wet material increases the rate of evaporation, more launching moisture from the product and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference between ambient temperature level and humidity temperature level, the higher the potential for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>The Inquirer found that in a lot of cases, wetness might have dripped in from the first day.
