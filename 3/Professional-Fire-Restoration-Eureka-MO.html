Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
