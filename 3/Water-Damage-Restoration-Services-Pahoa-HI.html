<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job correctly.
