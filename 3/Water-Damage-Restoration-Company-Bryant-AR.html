Once MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
