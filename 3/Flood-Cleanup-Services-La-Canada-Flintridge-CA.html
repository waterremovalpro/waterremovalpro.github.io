<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Unfavorable air machines, equipped with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") need to be used to eliminate bacteria and other pollutants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with appropriate waste holding tanks which need to be dealt with properly. Hard surface areas that are affected should be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard should be eliminated and correctly gotten rid of. Any material that soaks up substantial amounts of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned up must be removed. When infected products have actually been eliminated, a second application of sanitizers ought to be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
