<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
