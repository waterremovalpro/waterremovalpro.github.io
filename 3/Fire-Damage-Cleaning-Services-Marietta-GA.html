<p>Vapor pressure is directly associated to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and humidity). As heat is applied to a product, energy is added.

<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. When this combustible fuel - drywall, furnishings, or carpet - has been warmed to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unpredictable gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause enduring damage and ought to be handled by experienced experts, heat is the most noticeable, and devastating, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
