Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
