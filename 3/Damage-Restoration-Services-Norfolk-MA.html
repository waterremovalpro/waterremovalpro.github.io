<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
