<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a dangerous situation for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system can not work correctly (typical pipes issues in old homes ).
