<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a dangerous situation for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system can not work correctly (typical pipes issues in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to reduce the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (infections, germs and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those harmful materials can enter the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
