It is the slow and steady deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electricity, metal, oxygen and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently called rust). There is no reputable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts generally start corroding immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
