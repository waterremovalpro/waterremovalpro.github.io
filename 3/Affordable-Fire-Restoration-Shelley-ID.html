<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to remove it. They may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion if drywall panels only reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised.
