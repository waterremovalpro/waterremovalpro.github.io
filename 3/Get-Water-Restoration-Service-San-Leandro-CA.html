<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to complete.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (approximately 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Put your patch into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the substance. Plume the edges of the compound and permit it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint substance to complete the repair.
