<p>Flooding of a personal sewer system can be a dangerous scenario for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation till the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not operate appropriately (common pipes problems in old homes ).
