<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction between the oxygen that is present in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has been warmed to its distinct ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and must be handled by experienced experts, heat is the most obvious, and devastating, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
