<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase devices to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all really essential in managing high humidity that regularly causes mold growth in our environment.</p>

Homeowners can hire indoor air quality provider to help them in investigating and remediating mold.
