<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape.

Once the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is thought about to complete.<p>
