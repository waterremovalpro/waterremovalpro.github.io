<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Whitefish</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water easily.
