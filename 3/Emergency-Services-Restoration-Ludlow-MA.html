<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As mentioned, fast air motion across damp surface areas of assemblies or products is a critical component of successfully and effectively drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Fast air movement across the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area moisture paves the way to lowering moisture material in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require various requirements for changing conditions.</p>
