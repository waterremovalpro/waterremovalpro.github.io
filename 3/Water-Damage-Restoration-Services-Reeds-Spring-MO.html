<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
