<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings should be consisted of in the drying record to include air, heating and cooling, and equipment systems.

It is necessary to know that air records alone will not show that a building is dry.
