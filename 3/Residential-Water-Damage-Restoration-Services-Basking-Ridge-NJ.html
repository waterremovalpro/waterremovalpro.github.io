Surface area cleaning only gets rid of noticeable contamination, but considerable quantities of bacteria are typically left, which can potentially cause health issue as well as undesirable odors. All surfaces affected by water damage must be completely cleaned, sanitized and ventilated by skilled specialists in order to correctly remove disease-causing bacteria, fungi and other viruses before the area is safe for people again.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice appropriate cooking area maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.

Scrub mold from surface areas as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading out.</p>
