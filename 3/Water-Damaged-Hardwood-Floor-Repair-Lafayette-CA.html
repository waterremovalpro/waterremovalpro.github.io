<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also releases severe fumes and it even produces hazardous gas when combined with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave harmful residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent utilizing bleach and if you should utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
