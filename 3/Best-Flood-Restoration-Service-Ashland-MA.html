<p>Sadly, however, utilizing bleach is just reliable if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, tubs, glass and countertops. Bleach can not permeate into porous products and so it does not enter contact with mold growing underneath the surface area of products such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface but the roots within the material will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungis that quickly reach critical mass any place wetness is present indoors. This can result from any number of situations such as flooding, water build-up after a fire, a damaged pipe, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can cause difficulty. Any high degree of wetness, integrated with temperature and nutrients, creates the ideal environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to grow. It is essential to get rid of the source of the wetness to avoid the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
