<p>Vapor pressure is straight related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is applied to a material, energy is included.

<p>Class 2 - significant amount of water, evaporation, and absorption load. Water invasion where damp, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where materials referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have absorbed very little wetness.</p>

These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days.
