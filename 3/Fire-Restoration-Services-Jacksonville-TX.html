Drying fans were set up, heating pads were put on hardwood ceilings, floors and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, professional care. Really pleased with their swift shipment of emergency service AND their attention to detail to ensure the water damage was dried entirely.</p>
