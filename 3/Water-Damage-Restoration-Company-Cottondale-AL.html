<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally suggest disposing of particular types of things and surfaces. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common products in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which also includes sweeping and vacuuming up any dirt or minor particles neglected in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum guarantees that even small particles get gathered to lessen the possibilities of the mold moving somewhere else. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make doubly sure that mold does not find a way out of the contained work area and into a different part of the structure.</p>
