<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Purcellville</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed.

This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
