<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job appropriately.
