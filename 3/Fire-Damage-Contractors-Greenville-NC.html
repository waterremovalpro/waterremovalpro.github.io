<p>There is no substitute for training and experience. As fire and water damage experts, our organisation is built on fire and water restoration knowledge. We have the understanding and the customized equipment to get your residential or commercial property back to pre-fire condition. SERVPRO of Rutherford County is a cleaning and restoration company with a focus on water damage, fire damage, mold remediation, and general cleaning in a residential in addition to industrial capability.<p>
<p>We measure and log the moisture content of materials, and monitor and log progress so we know the real drying time and ensure restoration to the appropriate dry requirement. To start with, the restoration service technicians check the home and evaluate the extent of the smoke, fire, and soot damage. They also assess the damage from the water that was used to put out the fire. Doing so enables them to discover all the covert and noticeable damage.<p>
<p>But you may not have the ability to get insurance to pay for your mold remediation costs if the damage is a result of your neglect-- for example, if you have actually had a sluggish leakage under your bathroom sink for years and have ignored the concern. If the insurance provider can figure out that the mold damage is a result of your carelessness, they likely won't cover mold remediation expenses. Your property owner's insurance likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance coverage. If the flood has been stated a federal disaster by the President, make an application for assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
