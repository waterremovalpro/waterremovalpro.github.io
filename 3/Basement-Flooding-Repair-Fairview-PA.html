If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
