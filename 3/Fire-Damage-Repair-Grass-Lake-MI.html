<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Grass Lake</h3>
<p>Check the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Remove all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally jeopardized, they may be repairable by eliminating the damaged part. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
