<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is among the most terrible things that can take place to a household or a person.

<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
