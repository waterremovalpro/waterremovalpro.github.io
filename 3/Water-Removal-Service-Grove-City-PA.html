<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair.

Musty odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
