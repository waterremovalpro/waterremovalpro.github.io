<p>Do not remove this in the procedure of cleaning. When you are dealing with molds, turn off your furnace and air-conditioner. We don't want those spores spreading out all over the room and even your house and triggering some breathing and respiratory problems.

Soot, smoke and particles can be harmful to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged location. Wear long sleeves and pants to secure your skin.

Since you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is very important to set floor security and eliminate any furnishings or household items that are not damaged.
