<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration in Guilford</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By lowering the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>
