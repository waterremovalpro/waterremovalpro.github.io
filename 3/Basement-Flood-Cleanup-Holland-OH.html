<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same method, so if the place the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>If you have actually simply experienced a water event, you may be questioning what to do next: Permeating water damage is progressive, prevalent and can indicate important objects might become permanently damaged - specifically if emergency response is delayed beyond the very first two days.

If the mold is deemed to have actually come from water damage, some insurance providers may make you file a second claim of water damage instead, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation happens.</p>
