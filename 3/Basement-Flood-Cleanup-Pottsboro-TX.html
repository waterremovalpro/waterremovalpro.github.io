When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done effectively.
