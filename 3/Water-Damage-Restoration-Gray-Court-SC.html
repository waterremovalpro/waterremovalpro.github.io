Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really respectful individual.<p>
