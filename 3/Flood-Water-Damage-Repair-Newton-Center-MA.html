<p>For this reason, we produced a four-step technique that enables us to clean the afflicted area without compromising the rest of your home. We can help restore the environment in your house and offer irreversible treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or a low-cost brand-new one in a window to ventilate the room while working. Toss it out when you're done cleaning, since the spores are nearly difficult to clean off. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
<p>Do not attempt or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furnishings, drapes or other family fabric items. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the material, making cleaning more difficult. Use a dry, absorbent fabric to clean down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Make sure to get the wetness out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
