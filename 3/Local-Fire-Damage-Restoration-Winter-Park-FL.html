<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially look for any security risks, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted space entry. We then draw out standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has been affected, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely get rid of it. If they have actually been damaged, we will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that avoids water vapor from permeating walls) and remove them.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Winter Park</h3>
