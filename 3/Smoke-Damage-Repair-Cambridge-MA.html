<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
