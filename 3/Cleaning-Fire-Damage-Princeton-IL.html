The type of wood floor covering you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a broader series of options to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface.
