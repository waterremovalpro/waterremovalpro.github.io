<p>A/C: Heater and air conditioner systems can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot burner.

The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
