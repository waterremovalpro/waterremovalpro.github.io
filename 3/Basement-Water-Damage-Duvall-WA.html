<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach balance. Computing the humidity is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The higher the humidity increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
