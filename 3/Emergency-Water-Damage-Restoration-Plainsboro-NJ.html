Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have become polluted with molds.

When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
