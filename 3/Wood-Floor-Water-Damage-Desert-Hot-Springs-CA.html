These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
