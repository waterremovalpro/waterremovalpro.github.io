<p>The three staff members I had contact with were so valuable. The techs (Colby and Modo) came to my home to helps with water damage after being off for the day. They had gone home for the day however concerned my rescue although. Jennifer (the other employee) she was exceptional at interacting daily. She constantly called before coming by. She was flexible and gave me the complete picture of the scenario. I liked that she did not rush or push things. The team was respectful, expert, and worked as a group.

<p>An excellent way to prevent mold from growing in your home is to decrease humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, examine your home for leaks.

<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Clayton</h3>
<p>Before you clean the house, you must wear appropriate protection. Soot, particles and smoke can be unsafe to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged area. Use long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You must also use gloves and eye protection. Given that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is very important to set floor protection and get rid of any furniture or household things that are not damaged. If the damaged area is small, you can probably get away with simply covering furniture with plastic or sheets. But if you're cleaning a whole space, it's a good idea to remove those clean items and even seal off other spaces that are intact. Bear in mind the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot discolorations into other spaces.<p>
