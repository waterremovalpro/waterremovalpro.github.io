<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
