<p>To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by uncooked rice, recommending owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the stuff (cover it completely) and leave it there for two days or two. A: Mold is a microscopic fungi that is part of the natural environment and required for our community.
