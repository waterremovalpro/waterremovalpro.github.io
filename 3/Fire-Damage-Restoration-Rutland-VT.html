<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>After the water and moisture have been eliminated the next step to fix water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted areas. Flood water typically brings sewage and other toxins with it. These pollutants should be removed before final repairs are carried out. Commercial sanitizers and commercial cleaners will make sure that your home is successfully cleaned up and dealt with.</p>
