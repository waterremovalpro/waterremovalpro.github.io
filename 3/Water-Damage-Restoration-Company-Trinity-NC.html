Our technicians will then push clean all affected non-porous and semi-porous structure materials, such as wood, cement, and tile. Then, they will use bactericide in order to reduce the effects of bacteria and other impurities. Finally, technicians will force-dry the area using industrial structural drying equipment.<p>
<p>Remove any wall hangings, like pictures, if an area has sustained water damage. Keep them in a safe, dry place until they can be returned to the walls. Wipe down the walls, too, to reduce excess wetness. Craig: Kitchen issues. You now see water leaks and musty smells with the windows and doors closed.
