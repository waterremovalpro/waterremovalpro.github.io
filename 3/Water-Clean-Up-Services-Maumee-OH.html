<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Maumee</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals typically suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products soak up water quickly. This might aggravate the problem because as you know - mold loves damp environments.<p>
