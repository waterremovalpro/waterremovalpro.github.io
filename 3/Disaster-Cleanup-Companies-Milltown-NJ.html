<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air motion across damp surfaces of products or assemblies is a vital component of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of product ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
