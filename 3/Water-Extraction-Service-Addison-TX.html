Water intrusion where wet, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have absorbed minimal moisture.</p>
<p>Black mold can be dangerous if it is Stachybotrys black mold. Lots of molds can achieve the color of black, but not all mold is the terrifying Stachybotrys black mold. So how do you understand?
