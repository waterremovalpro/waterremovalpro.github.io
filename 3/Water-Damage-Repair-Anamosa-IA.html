<p>A/C: Heating system and ac system systems can become flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and douse pilot lights. They can also become muddy, and cleaning them will require professional cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and become polluted. They need to be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to avoid contamination from being blown through the air if that takes place.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a serious health threat, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate as much as 18 inches of drywall.

As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets.
