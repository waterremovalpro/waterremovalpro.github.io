<p>Drywall is actually a panel of plaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between 2 types of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Plaster Corporation put out a product called Sheetrock" implied to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering. Since it increased quickly without the requirement for wooden lathe, the product was billed as the poor man's response to plaster walls" By the 1950s and 60s, drywall had actually become a standard building and construction product.</p>
<p>After you learn how to remove mold, focus on avoiding it in the future. Controlling dampness is the crucial to stopping most mold. The worst infestations usually take place in damp crawl spaces, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outside, and in basements with bad foundation drainage.

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Visual: You might see that all mold is gone is away, however hidden mold colonies and mold spores can stick around in concealed places and in the air.
