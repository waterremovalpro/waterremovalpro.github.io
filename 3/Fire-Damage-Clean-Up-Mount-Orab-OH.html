<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Ceiling drywall panels may sag or crumble under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you might discover small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might broaden in time.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
