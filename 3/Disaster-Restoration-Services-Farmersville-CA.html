Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag before drying out, fixing it may simply need pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
