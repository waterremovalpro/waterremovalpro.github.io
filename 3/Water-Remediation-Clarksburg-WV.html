They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.
