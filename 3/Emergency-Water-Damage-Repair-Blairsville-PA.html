As discussed, fast air motion across damp surfaces of products or assemblies is an important element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Fast air motion throughout the surface of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness paves the way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying products need different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
