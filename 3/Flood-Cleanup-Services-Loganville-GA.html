Wear a facemask or a respirator ranked for black mold spore defense, and cover legs, hands and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold.

Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in a lot of hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent areas. If you use bleach, make sure it will not tarnish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a nearby exit rather than the primary home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
