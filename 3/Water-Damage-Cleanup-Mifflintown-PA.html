<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Since the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it wet can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop prior to drying out, repairing it may just require pushing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

In addition, as soon as mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be tough to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
