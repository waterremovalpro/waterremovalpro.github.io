<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the specialist will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
