<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling rural homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike.

<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
