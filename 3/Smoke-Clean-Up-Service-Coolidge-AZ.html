This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really costly paperweight.</p>
