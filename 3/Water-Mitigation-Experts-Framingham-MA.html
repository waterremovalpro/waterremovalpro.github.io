<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>It just takes a little water leak, or perhaps excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or organisation. Then, mold can spread out quickly through the residential or commercial property in as little as 2 days. Mold can produce allergens and irritants, and it has the possible to cause other health results. We can check and evaluate your residential or commercial property and utilize our specialized training, competence, and equipment to remediate your mold infestation if your home or company has a mold problem.</p>
