<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floorings and walls is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might need replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have taken place and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
