<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes.</p>
