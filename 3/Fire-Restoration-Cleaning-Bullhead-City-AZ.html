Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
