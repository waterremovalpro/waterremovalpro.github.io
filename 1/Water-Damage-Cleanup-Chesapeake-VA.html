Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
