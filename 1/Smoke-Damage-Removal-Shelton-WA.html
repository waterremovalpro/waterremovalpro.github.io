If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
