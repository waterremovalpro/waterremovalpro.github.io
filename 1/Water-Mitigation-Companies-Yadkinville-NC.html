There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
