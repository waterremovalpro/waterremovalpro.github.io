<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Beardstown</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repairs, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
