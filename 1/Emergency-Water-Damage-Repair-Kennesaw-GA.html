<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
