<p>Eliminating among the three requirements for mold minimizes (or gets rid of) brand-new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat given that mold typically does not grow in cold environments. I had a great experience working with the team at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, extremely communicative and punctual! I would absolutely suggest for any mitigation or restoration work you need.<p>
<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
