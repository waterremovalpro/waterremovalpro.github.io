Because a carpet cleaner can only do so much, you require a water damage cleanup team that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) soak up moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable bundles of desiccants and damp products in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants change color to indicate they are saturated, which can take weeks or days, depending on just how much wetness items contain.<p>
