<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done correctly.
