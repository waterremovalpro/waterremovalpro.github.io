<p>Walls or floors, this is a sure indication of mold development if there are dark areas on your ceiling. Musty smells and mildew are often indications that mold might be growing in your house. Respiratory and allergy signs such as coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and wheezing are a common indicator of mold development also. Likewise, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surface areas are an indication of mold.</p>
<p>Jake (and his group) are awesome to work with. They fasted to react initially and offered a affordable and reasonable quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done extremely rapidly. Our mold concern wound up being smaller sized than first believed so the final billing reflected the real work required and was less than first quoted. Jake was really responsive to calls and e-mails addressing questions throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a recognized irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing air-borne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health risks would not be decreased until mold pollutants are eliminated through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not suggest using ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
