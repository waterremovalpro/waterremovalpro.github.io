Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
