Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
