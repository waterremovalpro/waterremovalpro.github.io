Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments.</p>
