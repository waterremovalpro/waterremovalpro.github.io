Molds can be found in various forms; in fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, there are probably 10s of thousands of kinds of molds, if not more. Molds play a crucial role in breaking down leaves, plants and trees. While lots of molds are harmless, hazardous enters enclosed places can cause breathing distress, manifesting itself in signs that consist of stuffy noses and wheezing. The effects will be more extreme for those who are allergic to that mold or have asthma.
