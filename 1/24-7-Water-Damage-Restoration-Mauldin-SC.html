However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Equipment utilized in mold remediation consists of: moisture meter: measures drying of damaged products; Humidity gauge: often paired with a thermometer; borescope: Video camera at the end of a flexible snake, illuminating possible mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl areas; digital electronic camera: Documents findings throughout evaluation; personal protective equipment (PPE): Respirators, gloves, resistant suit, and eye defense; thermographic video camera: Infrared thermal-imaging electronic cameras identify secondary moisture sources.</p>
