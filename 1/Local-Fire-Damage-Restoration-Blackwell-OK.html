<p>Mold that is growing on basement walls or other surface areas may be scrubbed with one part bleach to eight parts water. Mold is a type of invasive fungis that might grow on surface areas inside your home. It varies in color and type, and is generally discovered in locations that have actually gone through moisture at some point in time, such as restrooms or in locations around dripping pipelines. Before you begin a project like this, provide the water damaged location an excellent clean. This is the textbook first step in any paint project, consisting of repairing water damage on walls.
