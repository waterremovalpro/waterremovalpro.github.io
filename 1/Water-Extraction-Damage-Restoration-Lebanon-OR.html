Try to find noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green).

<p>The next task is to clean away smoke, dust, and soot from your surface areas. After a fire, you will frequently find your home looks dark, stained, and charred.

Water damage can also cause health issue, so sanitization is especially essential.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke discolorations. This stage is necessary, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to lift stains from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water prior to you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or merely grab a new sponge. Make sure you use a wiping motion the entire time. If you scrub the stains, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
