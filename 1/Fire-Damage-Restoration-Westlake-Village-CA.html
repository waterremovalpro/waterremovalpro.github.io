<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable signs of wetness, dripping water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might observe small signs like coffee-colored spots that might expand over time.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a large brush, and keep in mind that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be eliminated and replaced. If basement carpet has actually ended up being moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to remove moisture if it's attached to the floor.</p>
