They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.

I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to do the job correctly.
