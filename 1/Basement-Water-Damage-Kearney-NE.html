<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish wear and tear of products (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you integrate electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts normally start corroding instantly after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How quick the corrosion procedure takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
