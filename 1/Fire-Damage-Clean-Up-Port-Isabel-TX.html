<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, however to add some clearness to the problem of mold, mold spores threaten. They are dangerous whether alive or dead. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning.

An extensive mold remediation and stain removal should be carried out to insure a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
