<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often twice a day) to monitor and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and likewise were really practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
