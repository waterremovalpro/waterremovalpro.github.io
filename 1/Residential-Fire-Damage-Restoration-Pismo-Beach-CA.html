<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
