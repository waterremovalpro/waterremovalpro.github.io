<p>Flooding can cause severe damage to a business building. Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overflowing waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be eliminated and the structure's contents need to be rapidly dried to prevent structural damage, mold development, and other problems.

But you can control mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>
<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier because it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is considered to finish.<p>
