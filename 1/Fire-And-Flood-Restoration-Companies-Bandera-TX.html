<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, quick air motion across wet surfaces of materials or assemblies is a crucial element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion throughout the surface of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface area moisture gives way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
