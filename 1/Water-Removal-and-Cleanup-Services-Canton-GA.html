They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and likewise were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
