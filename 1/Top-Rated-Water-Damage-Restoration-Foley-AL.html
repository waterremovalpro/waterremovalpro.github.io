The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most effective. It is necessary to figure out if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
