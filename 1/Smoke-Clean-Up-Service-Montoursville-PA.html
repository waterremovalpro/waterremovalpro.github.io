<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going individual.</p>
