<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair.

Musty odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have taken place and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>If a pipeline in your house has leaked for months and gone without repairs, mold can grow as an outcome, but it won't be covered by your property owners insurance. Considering that floods can likewise cause mold, any possible mold that grows as a result of a flood would be covered by flood insurance, if you have it. Must you submit a claim for mold damage, this cause would be evaluated and determined by the flood insurance adjuster.</p>
