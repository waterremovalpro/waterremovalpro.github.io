<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>
