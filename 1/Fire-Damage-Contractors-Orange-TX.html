<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending on the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>

<p>After eliminating the damaged drywall, measure the size of the hole so you can eliminate a spot from a new sheet of drywall. Place four drywall clips around the hole. Protect each one in place with a drywall screw, making certain to countersink the screw head. Beware not to overdrive the screw. Eliminate the patch and insert it, then secure it to the drywall clips (and available ceiling joists) using drywall screws. Beware not to over-tighten.<p>
