Did you know that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
