<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Remove all compromised drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just reveal water stains but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When eliminating around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
