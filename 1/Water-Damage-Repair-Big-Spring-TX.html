Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is moist and good, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

If they have actually been damaged, we will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that avoids water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them.</p>
