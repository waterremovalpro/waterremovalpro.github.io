<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
