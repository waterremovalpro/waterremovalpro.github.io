<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

Air filtering systems are usually used in conjunction with the sealing of the location to get rid of as lots of air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative air pressure, which avoids the flow of air in between the polluted space and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading as well.</p>

As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
