They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
