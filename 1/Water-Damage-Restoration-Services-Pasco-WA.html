<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and change the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Constantly gotten ready for an obstacle, Bales assembled a drying strategy that totally dried whatever in seven days with very little hassle to the staff and kids. Using modern equipment, Bales service technicians put small holes into the cabinets and walls on both sides, then forced air into and out of the trapped areas. We dried the carpet and pad in location and utilized HEPA air scrubbers to keep the air clean during the procedure. Restoration was unnecessary because of our drying strategies and equipment.</p>
