<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any situation, specifically when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater impends unless repaired rapidly, and the costs go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any tough surface areas to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be eliminated, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eradicated, typically involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
