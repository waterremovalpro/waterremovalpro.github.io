There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
