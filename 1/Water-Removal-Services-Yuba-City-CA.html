<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also provides off severe fumes and it even produces hazardous gas. There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce harmful fumes or leave harmful residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you should use it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
