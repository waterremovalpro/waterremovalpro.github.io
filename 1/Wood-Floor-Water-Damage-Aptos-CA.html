<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
