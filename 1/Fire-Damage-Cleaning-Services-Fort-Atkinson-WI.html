<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Fort Atkinson</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily. This might aggravate the problem since as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>
