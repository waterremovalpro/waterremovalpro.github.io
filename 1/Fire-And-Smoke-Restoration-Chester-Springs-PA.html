<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any scenario, especially when the hot water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater looms unless fixed quickly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, try to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can buy gadgets to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to reduce the production of wetness in the home are all really essential in managing high humidity that often triggers mold development in our climate.</p>
