<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Sunnyvale</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
