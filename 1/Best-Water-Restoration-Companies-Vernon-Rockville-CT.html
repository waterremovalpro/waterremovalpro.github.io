Underneath apparently unblemished outsides made from various products-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged whatever from window sills to insulation that once puffed like pink cotton candy. In some cases, wooden sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes easily, crumbling into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have infested some walls.</p>
