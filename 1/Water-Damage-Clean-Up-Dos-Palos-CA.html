<p>One day, I got back from work thinking I 'd be able to unwind. Instead, I came inside to rain putting down from the kitchen ceiling since my boy left on the bathroom faucet all day (9+ hours). I never needed to handle this prior to, so I googled and picked RestorePro based on all the positive reviews. From start to end up, it was an extremely favorable experience. They effectively completed the mitigation and then worked with me through the whole restoration to ensure that 1) quality work was done 2) we could update where I wanted while being very transparent about cost and 3) that my home and my family were treated with respect.
