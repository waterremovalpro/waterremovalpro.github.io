<h3>Restoration Cleaning Services in Stafford Virginia</h2>
<p>There are 3 basic steps to the water damage restoration process. The primary step is to get rid of all of the water from the affected property.

After scrubbing, leave the service for a little while to permit it to penetrate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is setting in, you may now tidy up the wall debris. Use a vacuum cleaner to eliminate the moldy wall.</p>
