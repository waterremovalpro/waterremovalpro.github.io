Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful individual.</p>
