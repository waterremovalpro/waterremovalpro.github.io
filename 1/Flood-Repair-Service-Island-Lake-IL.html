<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

There are over 100,000 kinds of types of mold, however the most typical types of mold grow within 3-5 days.
