<p>When you are preparing large repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
