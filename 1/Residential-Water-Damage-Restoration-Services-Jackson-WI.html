<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can offer your living room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and broke chimney can often allow rain throughout the cooler months which can seep through the walls. With time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, peel and flake. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into a exhausted and unloved space.<p>
<p>When dealing with damp drywall, remember to wear security goggles and masks. Utilize a laser level or other gadget to mark 6 inches above the waterline around the space if you're dealing with a basement flood scenario.
