<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very courteous individual.</p>
