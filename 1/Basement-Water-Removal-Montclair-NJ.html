<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, building envelope issues, and building and construction flaws are a very major matter.

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
