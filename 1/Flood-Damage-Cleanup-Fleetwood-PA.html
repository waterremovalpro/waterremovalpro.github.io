<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling since of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, particularly if you've never done it previously. Mold needs simply 3 things to grow and survive: moisture, humidity and darkness. The most common locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, ducts and crawlspaces. The best way to avoid mold development is to get rid of water leaks or moisture in your house. See our article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance pointers.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>Given that it's impossible to get rid of mold in your home completely, it is necessary to keep your air clear by frequently changing air filters.

You may also consider an air cleanser that will remove mold spores. If you reside in a particularly damp environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself remains devoid of mold.</p>
