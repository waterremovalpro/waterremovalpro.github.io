<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
