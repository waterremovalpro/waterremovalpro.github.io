Mold just needs two or three days to start growing after a flood or other damaging water event. To prevent having a mold problem brought on by a water occasion, take a look at these water recovery suggestions and arrange to have the water got rid of within two days, if possible.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep pictures of the water damage and all files related to the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future.

If the mold is considered to have come from water damage, some insurance providers may make you file a second claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>
<p>A great way to avoid mold from growing in your house is to minimize humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, check your home for leaks. Mop it up rapidly and dry the area if water does enter your home. Likewise, attempt to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, of course) or putting fans in your space. And keep your indoor humidity below 60%.</p>

Our group will carefully monitor development and record wetness levels until Balance Wetness Material (EMC) has been reached.<p>
