There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can use to evaluate a mold sampling outcome.

Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
