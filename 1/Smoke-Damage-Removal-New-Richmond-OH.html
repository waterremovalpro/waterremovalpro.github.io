<h3>Local Fire Damage Restoration in New Richmond</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals typically suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This might worsen the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold likes damp environments.<p>
