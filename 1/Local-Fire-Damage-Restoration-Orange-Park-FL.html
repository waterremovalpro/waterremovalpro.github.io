<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any scenario, specifically when the water heater system is located inside the home.

<p>The most crucial aspect of treating drywall water damage is to prevent additional damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew take place most often.

Standard home fans are not capable of moving an adequate quantity of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>

This process takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily run below freezing temperatures.</p>
