<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The most successful water damage restoration tasks start with an extensive extraction; our exclusive extraction equipment will begin things off on the right foot. We will then provide you with a drying plan and the correct devices to finish the procedure. We invest greatly in the most updated drying devices to manage the drying procedure. Cutting edge inspection tools will validate the drying procedure and even help in locating any surprise pockets of water.</p>
