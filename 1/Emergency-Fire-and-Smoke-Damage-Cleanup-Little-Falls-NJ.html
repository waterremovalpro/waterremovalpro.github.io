<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his guys were incredible in assisting us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were extremely valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
