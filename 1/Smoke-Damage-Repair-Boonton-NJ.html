<h3>Mold Water Damage Boonton NJ 07005</h3>

A fireplace can provide your living-room a sense of warmth and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can often allow rain throughout the cooler months which can seep through the walls. With time, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>
