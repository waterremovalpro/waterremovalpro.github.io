<p>Drying Out: Once the mold is consisted of in a space, we proceed to clear it out and then dry off the moisture. For soft, washable products, such as clothes and bed linen, first decide if the item deserves keeping. Smoke is tough to fully get rid of, and you may have more important things to hang around on. Multiple wash cycles - without letting the products dry in between - might be required.
