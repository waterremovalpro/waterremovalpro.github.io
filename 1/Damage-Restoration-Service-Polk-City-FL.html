<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or techniques will be the most reliable. It is important to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building products and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
