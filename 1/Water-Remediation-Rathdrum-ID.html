Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve.
