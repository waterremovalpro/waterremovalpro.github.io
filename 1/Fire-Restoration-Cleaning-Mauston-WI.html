Look for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).
