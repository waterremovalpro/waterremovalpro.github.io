They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to get the job done properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
