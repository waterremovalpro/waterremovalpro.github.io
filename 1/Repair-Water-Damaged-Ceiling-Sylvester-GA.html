While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
