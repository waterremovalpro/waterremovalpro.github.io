The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Among the products we utilize to address mold problems is the resurfacing agent Microorganism Guard, which develops a brand-new, permanent layer over a surface area.
