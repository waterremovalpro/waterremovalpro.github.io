<p>Fire damage can often jeopardize walls, roofing systems, and windows. To preserve security and to safeguard against further damage, the SERVPRO Franchise Expert can board up missing windows and walls and location tarps on damaged roofs. A: Mold needs a damp environment, temperature levels above freezing and a food source, which might be leaves, paper, dirt, wood or other building products. Mold is more likely to be found in moist, dusty spaces or areas with stagnant air.<p>

<p>You wish to deal with restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
