Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag before drying out, repairing it may simply need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

We proudly serve clients in Alexandria VA and the surrounding areas. Do not paint or caulk musty surfaces. Tidy up the mold and dry the surfaces prior to painting. Paint applied over moldy surface areas is most likely to peel.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs moisture, although some mold types can get that moisture from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Thoroughly pry baseboards away from walls so that you can examine sheetrock at floor level. The permeable product can quickly take in flood water, and you need to understand the extent of potential damage.<p>
