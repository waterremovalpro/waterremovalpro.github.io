<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is good and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Substantial smoke damage can leave your residential or commercial property charred and blemished. It can stain walls and ceilings yellow and warp wood and plastic.

<p>The most effective method to avoid mold growth on water damage is to start the drying procedure rapidly.

<p>Since large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged locations larger than 12 square inches might require a total replacement panel installed. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out.
