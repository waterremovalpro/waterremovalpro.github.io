<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Pinson: What to Do After a Storm</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you truly want to avoid buying a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and wipe it straight over mold development. Let the option sit for approximately 10 minutes, and after that scrub the area with a little brush or toothbrush. Wipe any remaining mold away with a towel and let the location dry.</p>
