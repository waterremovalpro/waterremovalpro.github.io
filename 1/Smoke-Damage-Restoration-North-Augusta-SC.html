<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many people swear by uncooked rice, recommending owners to put their damp iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the stuff (cover it entirely) and leave it there for 2 days approximately. A: Mold is a microscopic fungi that is part of the natural environment and essential for our environment.
