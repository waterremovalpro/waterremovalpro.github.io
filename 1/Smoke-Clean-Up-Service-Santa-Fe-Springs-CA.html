Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on walls and floors is another prospective effect of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending on the degree of damage. Musty smells can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have actually taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air flow near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to lessen the production of moisture in the home are all really important in managing high humidity that often causes mold development in our climate.</p>
