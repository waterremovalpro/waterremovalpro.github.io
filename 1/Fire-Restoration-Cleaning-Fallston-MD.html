<p>Permeable materials consist of carpet, insulation, fabric, and similar products. If they have actually been soaked in water, you might have to cut them out and toss them away Water will permanently damage most permeable materials by shrinking or deforming them, and mildew will damage them even further. And if you have a beloved furniture piece you want to save, you might try separating and drying it out, but the damage might currently be done, especially if you see drywall water damage. Note that unsealed cement, drywall, and wood are also porous materials.</p>
