<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or techniques will be the most reliable. It is important to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be calculated by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building products and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
