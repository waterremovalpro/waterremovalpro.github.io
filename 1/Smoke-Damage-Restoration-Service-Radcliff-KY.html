<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we periodically recommend discarding specific types of surface areas and things. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common products in requirement of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which also consists of vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles ignored in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get gathered to minimize the chances of the mold moving in other places. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make doubly sure that mold doesn't discover an escape of the included work area and into a different part of the structure.</p>
