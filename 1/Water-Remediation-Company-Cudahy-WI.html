<p>Since typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
