Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
