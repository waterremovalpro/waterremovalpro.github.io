Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days.
