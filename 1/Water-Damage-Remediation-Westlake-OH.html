<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
