<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days.
