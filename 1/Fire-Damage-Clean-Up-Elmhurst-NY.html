<p>You wish to address bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>When small mold spores take a trip through the air and settle, under the right conditions, mold or mildew can increase rapidly, frequently going undiscovered, and become an issue inside your home.
