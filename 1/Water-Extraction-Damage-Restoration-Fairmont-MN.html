<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Crawl areas frequently grow mold for the exact same reasons as basements do-they tend to remain moist long-lasting. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and generally have more ventilation, so they do not tend to have as large a mold growth area, making normal expenses better to $500 for remediation. Because of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this area is typically less extreme, so removing and cleaning affected areas is frequently adequate.</p>
