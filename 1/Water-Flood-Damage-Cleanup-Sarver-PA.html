<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold development (it might look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>In Florida, the assessment and remediation of mold damage require a state license. We have both a license and comprehensive training in completing these jobs and always work towards a bring back over replace approach.

<p>During the evaluation stage of water damage repair, experts will let you know what parts of the space need to be either repaired or changed totally.

Flooring is generally replaced, including installing brand-new carpets and hardwood floor covering Any kind of electrical system is never fixed and for security reasons is changed completely. Wall and ceiling leakage repair expenses might start at $200, while electrical rewiring can be as much as $8,000.</p>
