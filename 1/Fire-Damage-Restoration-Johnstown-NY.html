Fast air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Water damage occurs from broken pipelines, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends upon the nature of the damage.
