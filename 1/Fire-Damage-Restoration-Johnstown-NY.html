The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Water damage occurs from broken pipelines, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends upon the nature of the damage.
