<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has affected stretching suburban houses, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics constructed with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that involves a substantial quantity of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying might need special techniques, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>A fire can result in significant damage to a space. The smoke and soot damage along with the resulting water damage, needs site cleanup and restoration to recuperate what was once a sound structure.

After an initial inspection, damaged materials are cleaned up and smoke odors are eliminated. Areas are dried and repairs are made, flipping your property back to its pre-damaged state.</p>

<p>Class 1 - least quantity of absorption, evaporation, and water load. Water invasion where damp, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent less than ~ 5% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where products referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in minimal moisture.</p>
