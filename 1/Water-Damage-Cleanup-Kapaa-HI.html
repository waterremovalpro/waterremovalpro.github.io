Sealing the area involves making use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the circulation of air between the polluted space and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be turned off to avoid the mold from spreading out too.</p>
<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating option, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this procedure in order to guarantee the solution stays well mixed.)
