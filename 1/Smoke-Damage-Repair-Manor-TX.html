If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and need to be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
