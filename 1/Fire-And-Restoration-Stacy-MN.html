<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
