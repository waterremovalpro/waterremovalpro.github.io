<p>You wish to attend to restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>

Water damage accompanies almost every type of disaster. Floods, sewage backup, earthquakes, and even house fires indicate water in your house where it should not be.
