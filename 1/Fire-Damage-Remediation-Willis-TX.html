<p>The primary priority will constantly be to prevent damage from getting worse when restoration starts in earnest. For instance, a hole burned in an exterior wall or your roof would receive immediate attention. Fire damage restoration also often works together with water damage restoration If the fire has actually damaged a pipe or water tank, it's important to stop the water damage prior to it spreads out.<p>
<p>But you might not be able to get insurance coverage to spend for your mold remediation expenses if the damage is a result of your disregard-- for example, if you've had a slow leakage under your bathroom sink for many years and have overlooked the issue. They likely won't cover mold remediation costs if the insurer can identify that the mold damage is a result of your carelessness.
