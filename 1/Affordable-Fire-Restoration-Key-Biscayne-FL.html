<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a household or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
