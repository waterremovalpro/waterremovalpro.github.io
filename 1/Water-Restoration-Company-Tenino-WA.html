<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Tenino</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
