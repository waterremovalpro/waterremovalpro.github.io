<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then wipe it away with a wet towel. Just like some of the above techniques, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
