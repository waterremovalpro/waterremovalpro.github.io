<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice sufficient kitchen area maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from tough surface areas, and fix leaky faucets as quickly as possible. Constantly ensure your tableware and serving meals are dry prior to storing them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to avoid it from spreading out.</p>
