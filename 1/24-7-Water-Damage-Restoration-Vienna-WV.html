<h3>Why You Should Hire Vienna Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
