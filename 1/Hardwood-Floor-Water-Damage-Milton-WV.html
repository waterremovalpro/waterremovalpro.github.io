In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
