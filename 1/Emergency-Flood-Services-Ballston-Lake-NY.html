They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly.
