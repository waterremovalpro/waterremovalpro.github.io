<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected stretching rural homes, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties built with materials other than stucco had issues, too. Some houses with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
