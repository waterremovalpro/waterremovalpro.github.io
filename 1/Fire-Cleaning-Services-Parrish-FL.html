<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By decreasing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
