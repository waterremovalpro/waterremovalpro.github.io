If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
