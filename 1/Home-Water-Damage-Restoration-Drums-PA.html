These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as paints and adhesives. Mold requires moisture, although some mold types can acquire that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent.

The porous product can rapidly take in flood water, and you need to understand the degree of potential damage.<p>
