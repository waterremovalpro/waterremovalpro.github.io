<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any scenario, particularly when the hot water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired quickly, and the expenses increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>

We will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
