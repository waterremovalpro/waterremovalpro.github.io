<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most effective. It is imperative to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
