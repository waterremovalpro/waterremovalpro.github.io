<p>Then, if water has penetrated to the subfloor, we will continue water extraction there, and institute drying treatments for the subfloor utilizing dehumidifiers and air movers. Then specialists will inspect your residential or commercial property for any additional structural damage. Expense assessments: In some cases it is more cost reliable to utilize less devices over a slightly longer amount of time. Sometimes it is more expense efficient to take longer to dry versus to destroy and repair.<p>
<p>Keep in mind: While many experts recommend a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for managing both mold development and dust mites.
