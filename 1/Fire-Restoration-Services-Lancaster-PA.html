<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, developing envelope issues, and building defects are an extremely serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many concerns due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage.

<p>Mold developments (nests) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is essential to act right away if you have a water spill or leak-- especially if you reside in a humid or hot climate.

At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more.
