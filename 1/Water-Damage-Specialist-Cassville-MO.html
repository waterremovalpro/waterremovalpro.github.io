<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - drywall, carpet, or furnishings - has been heated to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger long lasting damage and should be handled by knowledgeable professionals, heat is the most obvious, and harmful, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
