<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful situation for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewer system can not function appropriately (typical plumbing issues in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater depend on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to decrease the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, germs and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those harmful products can go into the groundwater and your drinking water supply.</p>
