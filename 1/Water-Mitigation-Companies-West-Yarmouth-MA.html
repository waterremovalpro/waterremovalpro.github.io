<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is typically described as black mold or hazardous mold because of the mycotoxins that it can release.

In addition to being damaging, black mold can likewise stain surfaces it grows on, which can make it harder to effectively eliminate. Typically, surface areas with black mold may require additional bleaching or replacement to deal with the spots. In many cases, an encapsulating representative might be essential to cover the stain and any remaining spores.</p>
