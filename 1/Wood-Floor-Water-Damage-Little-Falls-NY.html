When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
