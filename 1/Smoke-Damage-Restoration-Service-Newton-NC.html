<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or service is one of the most destructive things that can happen to an individual or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being fully replaced. If there is small damage then most of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need repairing. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might need replacing and in some cases even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you might have determines and restricts the type of repairs that need to take place. Strong hardwood flooring enables a larger series of choices to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This type of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The very best method to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
