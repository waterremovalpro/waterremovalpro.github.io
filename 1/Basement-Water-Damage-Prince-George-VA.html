<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace right away.

<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.<p>
