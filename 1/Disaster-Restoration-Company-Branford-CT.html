<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
