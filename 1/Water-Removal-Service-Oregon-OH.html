<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. When InstaScope was developed, we engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was appointed to confirm and evaluate the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other technique or device, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery right away. Eliminating the battery rapidly might make the difference to save your phone. A lot of phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has damaged the gadget. You can attempt to draw the wetness out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product overnight. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water long.</p>
