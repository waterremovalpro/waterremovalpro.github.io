<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
