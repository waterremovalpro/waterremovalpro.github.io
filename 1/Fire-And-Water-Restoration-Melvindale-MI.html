Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is damp and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient amount of air needed to dry a space sufficiently.</p>
