<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or company is among the most terrible things that can take place to an individual or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing, if there is minor damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor may require changing and sometimes even the subfloor too. The type of wood floor covering you might have identifies and limits the type of repairs that require to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a wider range of alternatives to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
