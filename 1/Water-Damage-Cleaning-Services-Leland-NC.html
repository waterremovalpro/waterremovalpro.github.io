<h3>Computer Water Damage Leland NC 28451</h3>
<p>With over 40 years of construction background, Elite Restoration is your very first call for wind, water, fire, or any other residential or commercial property damage. It's an unfortunate truth that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Probably the most typical is the smashed screen, which we discuss in our article on getting a damaged iPhone repaired But the second most common is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home might need to be reconstructed. Products like drywall and carpet that have actually soaked up water often establish bacteria and mold that can't be eliminated.

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
