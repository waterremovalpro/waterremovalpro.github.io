By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
