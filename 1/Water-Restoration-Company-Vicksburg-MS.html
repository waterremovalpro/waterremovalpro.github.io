These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.
