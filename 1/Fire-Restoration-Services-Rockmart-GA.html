<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.
