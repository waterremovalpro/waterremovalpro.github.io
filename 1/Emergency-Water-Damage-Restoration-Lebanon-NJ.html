<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

The humidity always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind.
